- 👋 Hi, I’m @Take1ByteAtaTime
- 👀 I’m interested in learning data structures and creating effective algorythms as I am new to coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3, Linux, C, and C++.  Attending Montana Tech for Software Engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing more elegant code, and best practices so I can work well on a team.
- 📫 I can be reached at mnelson5@mtech.edu, or on Discord at Mike Nelson#2604.
